# path-of-least-something
In this repo, I try to create an algorithm that finds a path that minimizes the given parameter, starting with collisions.

## QQ ##
-__Is this algorithm going to be particulalry efficient?__ No, no it is not.

-__Has someone thought about the algorithm I end up making?__ Maybe.

-__So why I am doing it?__ I am currently in winter break during COVID, and hence I have way too much time on my hands, and this seems fun to do.

## A bit more detailed description of what I want to do here: ##

I want to create a java program/API that takes in input from a text file about a `board` that can represent a maze/forest/what not; a starting position (`sx`,`sy`); and a parameter to minimize (for example the number of collisions with a given object).

I am inital going to work on an algorithm that minimizes the number of collisions with a `tree` - represented by the character "#" in the `board`, but while I am at it, use OOP concepts to make changing the path finding algorithm, or the goal of the path finding algorithm, or really anything relvant as simple as creating a subclass and overloading a method.

## The algorithm itself ##
Coming soon!
